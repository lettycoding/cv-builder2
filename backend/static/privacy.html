        <h1>Privacy Policy for CV Builder App</h1>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the CV Builder application (the "App").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information you provide directly to us when you use the App to build your CV. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Identification Information:</strong> Your name, contact details (email, phone number, city).</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Information:</strong> Your professional experience (job titles, companies, dates, responsibilities), education (degrees, institutions, years, details), professional profile summary, skills, and achievements.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional Information:</strong> A profile image if you choose to upload one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information from Third-Party Services (e.g., LinkedIn Import)</h3>
        <p>If you choose to use our "Import from LinkedIn" feature, you explicitly authorize us to access and import specific information from your LinkedIn profile (such as your name, job title, contact details, work experience, education, skills, and achievements) to pre-populate your CV fields within the App. We only access the data necessary for this purpose and do not store your LinkedIn login credentials.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Build Your CV:</strong> The primary purpose is to enable you to create, edit, and manage your curriculum vitae within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>To Generate Documents:</strong> To generate downloadable documents of your CV (e.g., PDF files) based on the information you have provided.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> We may use aggregated and anonymized data to understand how users interact with the App and to improve its features and user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>Your CV data is primarily for your own use within the App. Any sharing of your CV (e.g., by downloading a PDF and sending it to an employer) is done solely at your discretion and initiation.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain the information you provide for as long as you use the App. If you cease using the App or delete your data within the App, your information will be removed. Please note that if the App is running locally on your device, your data might be stored directly on your device.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Edit:</strong> Access and modify the personal information you have provided within the App at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete your personal information from the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Request a copy of your data (e.g., by downloading your CV).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
